                    <p> I love to build on the web and solve challanges. </p>
                    <p> My passion began at the age of 9, wanting to know how the web worked. I saw how people collaborating online on forums, such as <a href="https://github.com/RafaelH-us" target="_blank">Github</a> and I wanted to be part of it. I have been
                      hooked on building digital assets whether it is Web, Video, Audio, Graphics or Image manipultaion I can not get enough. </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom:30px;">Note: This is my lab so somethings may not work but I am always constantly updating things. Enjoy.</p>
